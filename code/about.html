            <h1> About </h1>

            <p>
            This page is about the SRM Collider. It will provide some 
            information about the algorithm and a link to the source 
            code.
            </p>

            <p>
            The SRM Collider is intented as a tool to support
            experimental biologists in creating specific and, if possible,
            unique SRM-assays for a peptide in a given background.
            </p>

            <h1> Algorithm </h1>

            <p>
            The SRM Collider can analyse all transitions of a given peptide
            in a given background.
            </p>

            <p>
            It will compare the transition of the query peptide to the complete
            list of transitions generated from the background genome. The
            program will consider 3 dimensions: Q1 mass, Q3 mass and retention
            time. If there is another transition from the background "close
            enough", it will report a so called "collision". The definition of
            "close enough" can be adjusted with the input form, by setting
            (like in a real experiment) Q1, Q3 and RT windows.
            </p>

            <p>
            Retention times are not experimental but theortical and calulated
            using the "SSRCalc tool". Thus the reported values are not
            retention times but rather an hydrophobicity index that helps to
            estimate how close together two peptides elute. Please refer to the
            SSRCalc paper for more information.
            </p>

            <p>
            It is also possible to calculate UIS (unique ion signatures) for
            peptides. This means that combinations of transitions are
            considered and analysed for uniqueness within a given RT window. In
            order to calculate global UIS, just set the RT window to a very
            large value. Please refer to the UIS paper for more information.
            </p>

            <h1> Download Data </h1>
            
            <p>
            The results of the analysis can be downloaded in CSV (comma
            separated values) format which is Excel and OpenOffice compatible.
            While the "collision analysis" can be performed in batches, UIS can
            only be calculated for one peptide at a time and only up to an
            order of 5. Otherwise, the resources of the webserver are
            used up.
