/*
 * This file contains functions that allow the user to execute one calculation
 * of UIS or minimal number of transitions needed for a peptide with one call.
 * This means that instead of calling several functions after each other and
 * passing data structures between Python and Cpp, all can be done in Cpp which
 * is faster.
 *
 * Thus it combines the functionality of rangetree.cpp and getNonUis.cpp in one.

     * This function uses "bitwise operations" to speed up the calculation: each combination of
     * transitions is encoded in an integer, which allows easy storage and
     * computation by bitshifts even though the code gets less easy to understand.
     * The default length of the integer is 32 bits thus we can at most handle
     * combinations for 31 transitions; if more are needed one needs to change
     * COMBINT to an integer format that uses more bits, e.g. unit64_t or even the
     * BigInt class for larger integers.
     * If there are more transitions provided than allowed, an error will be
     * thrown.
