/*
 * This file contains functions that allow the user to execute one calculation
 * of UIS or minimal number of transitions needed for a peptide with one call.
 * This means that instead of calling several functions after each other and
 * passing data structures between Python and Cpp, all can be done in Cpp which
 * is faster.
 *
 * Thus it combines the functionality of rangetree.cpp and getNonUis.cpp in one.

   * COMBINT to an integer format that uses more bits, e.g. unit64_t or even the
   * BigInt class for larger integers.
